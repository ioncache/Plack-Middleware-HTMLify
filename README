VERSION
    version 0.1.1

SYNOPSIS
        use Plack::Builder;

        my $app = sub {
            return [ 200, [ 'Content-Type' => 'text/plain' ], [ 'Hello Foo' ] ];
        };

        builder {
            enable "HTMLify",
                set_doctype    => "...", # html for the doctype
                set_head       => "...", # html to include in <head>
                set_body_start => "...", # html for the beginning of the <body>
                set_body_end   => "..."; # html for the end of the <body>
            $app;
        };

DESCRIPTION
    Plack::Middleware::HTMLify is meant to be used to transform non-html web
    content into html.

    Use case: On CPAN, the 'source' link is delivered as 'text/plain'. If
    you wanted to do some post-processing of this page to add syntax
    highlighting you would need the page to be set as 'text/html' and have
    some basic HTML formatting.
