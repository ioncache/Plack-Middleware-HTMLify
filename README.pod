=head1 DESCRIPTION

Plack::Middleware::HTMLify is meant to be used to transform non-html web content
into html.

Use case:
On CPAN, the 'source' link is delivered as 'text/plain'.  If you wanted to do
some post-processing of this page to add syntax highlighting you would need the
page to be set as 'text/html' and have some basic HTML formatting.
